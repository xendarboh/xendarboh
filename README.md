Greetings, I am Xendarboh! I'm passionate about nature, open source, and new technologies.

Currently exploring **Hackathons** as a creative outlet for expressing skill,
networking, entrepreneurial endeavours, and collectively building the frontier.

## Some of My Projects

### [xen/dev:latest](https://github.com/xendarboh/xendev)

A modern portable containerized terminal-based vim-centric development
environment. It's like a living curated [Awesome
List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) with my personal "dotfiles" and
terminal apps that are easy to run and use. It has configurable options to
balance enhanced security sandboxing with convenience features.
