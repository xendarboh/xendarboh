Greetings, I am Xen!

I'm passionate about nature, open source, and collectively building the frontier with new technologies.

## Buidling the Future

The Zero Knowledge Network is an advanced private communications platform. It uses [post-quantum mixnet](https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost) deployments, zero-knowledge proof verification, and tamper-resistant edge hardware to secure data with verifiable authenticity while keeping it private with strong anonymity. Users, weather human or machine, connect to the Network using the [ZKNetwork Client](https://github.com/ZeroKnowledgeNetwork/client). ZKN's first application, Walletshield, provides metadata-private blockchain interactions to a growing number of supported chains.

zkHumans is a self-sovereign decentralized identity protocol that combines Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Crypto-Biometrics to create secure, private programmable identities with cross-organizational utility. The platform powers Decentralized Society through privacy-preserving identity management, access-control, consensus mechanisms, and economic innovation tools, representing an emerging vision of a more sovereign, interoperable, and human-centric internet that drives collective prosperity.

### [xen/dev:latest](https://github.com/xendarboh/xendev)

A modern portable containerized terminal-based vim-centric development
environment. It's like a living curated [Awesome
List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) with my personal "dotfiles" and
terminal apps that are easy to run and use. It has configurable options to
balance enhanced security sandboxing with convenience features.

### [humanode-tellr](https://github.com/xendarboh/humanode-tellr)

A [Humanode](https://humanode.io/) node (humanode-peer) bioauth status reporter, aka a "teller." Run this on your Humanode node to receive notifications if your bioauth status becomes inactive, is expiring within a specified timeframe, or if humanode-peer goes down.
